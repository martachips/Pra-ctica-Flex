            Now that you have a page with most of your content, the next step is
            to make it fit all screens. You will focus on responsiveness this
            week. Follow the next steps, focusing on these three areas:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>The wrappers- does everything fit?</li>
            <li>The layout - how does the content flow?</li>
            <li>The typography</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            In the end we want you to choose 2-3 sections/areas of your page
            that you want to fix.
